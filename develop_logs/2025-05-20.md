**Project/Module**: TorchNetViz

---

## ✅ Completed Work
- [x] Model Auto Instantiation
  - Implemented model loading via inspect and brute-force instantiation methods.
- [x] Input Shape Inference
  - Automatically captures input shapes during forward pass using inspection or heuristic-based methods.
  - Enables automatic tracing of models with minimal user input.
- [x] Model Structure Parsing
  - Parses module connections and network topology using torch.fx.
- [x] Basic Graph Visualization
  - Generates simple graph diagrams using plotly.
  - Visualizes nodes as dots and connections as lines (basic layout).

## 🚧 Work in Progress / To Be Done
- [ ] Improve Jump Connection Detection
  - Recognize operations like add, cat as skip connections.
- [ ] Optimize Graph Generation
  - Improve node layout and edge routing for better readability.


## 📝 Notes & Action Items
- Note 1: Compared with existing libraries, TorchNetViz uses fx to parse model structure, which is more subtle.
- Action Item: None
