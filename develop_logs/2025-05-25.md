## ✅ Completed Work
- [x] Optimized graph visualization with multi-color and multi-style support for enhanced clarity and aesthetics.
- [x] Addressed the "non-matching ReLU/GELU" issue by treating it as a design feature — this behavior arises because ReLU/GELU activations are defined only once (or less than times it is used) within the module's init method and may be reused multiple times throughout the network.
- [x] Rebuild project structure, especially for /parser.
- [x] Rewrite shape_inference with multi-threading and better error handling.

## 🚧 Work in Progress / To Be Done
- [ ] Match inputs to _tensor_constant via node.next.
- [ ] Process nn.Sequentials.
