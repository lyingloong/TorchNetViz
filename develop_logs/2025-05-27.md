**Project/Module**: TorchNetViz

---

## ✅ Completed Work
- [x] Optimized multithreading to prevent excessive threads from entering the thread pool.
- [x] Added dynamic error feedback adjustment mechanism in shape inference.
- [x] Improved input shape generation logic for better efficiency and accuracy, especially fluent for TimeXer.

## 🚧 Work in Progress / To Be Done
- [ ] Use torch._dynamo to fit with complicated models like TimeXer(instead of fx).
- [ ] Match inputs to _tensor_constant via node.next.
- [ ] Process nn.Sequentials in graph_generator.
- [ ] Bug: in MLP shape_inference:
  - Error during shape combo evaluation: cannot access free variable 'future_to_shape' where it is not associated with a value in enclosing scope
